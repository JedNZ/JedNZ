- 👋 Hi, I’m @JedNZ
- 👀 I’m interested in Mac computers, but more specifically the 4,1 2009 and 5,1 2010 and 2012 Mac Pros (cMP).
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to keep my cMP going.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on extending the life of cMPs.
- 📫 You can reach me through my posts, or over at MacRumors.com (JedNZ)
